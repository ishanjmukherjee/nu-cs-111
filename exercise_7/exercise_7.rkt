; ; printf basics
; -------------
; 
; printf (which stands for print formatted)
; can be used to print (or produce) a string in the REPL (the bottom window),
; with arguments that are formatted as strings.
; 
; For example:
; 
; > (printf "number ~a" 1)
; number 1
; 
; Here, the ~a tells printf, whatever comes after the string, substitute that for ~a, which
; is the number 1 in this case
; 
; You can use multiple ~a's, as such:
; 
; > (printf "numbers ~a, ~a, and ~a!" 1 2 3)
; numbers 1, 2, and 3!
; 
; ~n tells printf to create a new line (i.e. a line break):
; 
; > (printf "~n numbers")
; 
;  numbers

; Part 1
; Define the question struct and its methods here. 

; a question is a ....
; (make-question string symbol number)

(define-struct question (text answer point-value)
  #:methods
  (define (display q)
    (printf "question: ~a ~n" (question-text q)))
  (define (check-answer q response)
    (equal? (question-answer q) response)))
    

; A sample 
(define q1 (make-question "What is the home country of the Black Panther?" 'wakanda 3))

; Tests to see if the methods are both defined
(check-expect (procedure? display) true)
(check-expect (procedure? check-answer) true)

; Test to see if it's a question
(check-expect (question? q1) true)

; Test to check the question-text is correct
(check-expect (question-text q1) "What is the home country of the Black Panther?")

; Test to check that the check-answer method works
(check-expect (check-answer q1 'wakanda)
              true)

; Test 6 - Check an answer that would be false, like 'atlantis
; Test 7 - Check the point value is 3.

; Part 2
; Define the multiple-choice-question struct and its methods here.

(define-struct (multiple-choice-question question) (number-of-choices choices)

; a multiple choice question is a ...

(define q2

   "In the post-credits scene of The Avengers movie, what food
do the six Avengers go to eat?"
   '1 3 3
   (list "Shawarma" "Kabobs" "Manakish")))

; Test 1 - check to see q2 is a question
; Test 2 - check to see if q2 is a multiple-choice-question
; Test 3 - check to see the number-of-choices is 3
; Test 4 - Check to make sure the answer is '1
; Test 5 - Check its point value is 3
; Test 6 - Check how many choices there are

; Part 3
; Define the numeric-question struct and its methods here.

                            (numeric-question-error-range q))))
        true
        false)))

; a numeric question is a ...
;  - (make-numeric-question string symbol number number)

(define q3 (make-numeric-question "What version or mark armor does Tony Stark
 use during the Battle of Earth featured in Avengers: Endgame?" 85 3 2))

; Test 1 - Test to see if q3 is a question
; Test 2 - Test to see if it's a numeric-question
; Test 3 - Test to see it's NOT a multiple-choice-question
; Tests 4 to 7 - Test the range of accepted results (84, 85, 86 all should work...but 88 should not)
