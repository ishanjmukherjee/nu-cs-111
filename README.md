# CS 111: Fundamentals of Computer Programming I

Materials for Northwestern University's course [CS 111: Fundamentals of Computer Programming I, Fall 2023](https://class-descriptions.northwestern.edu/4920/MEAS/COMP_SCI/14898).

I received a perfect score on every Exercise. I didn't submit the majority of Tutorials and Advanced Tutorials since there was attendance credit, so they didn't get scored.
